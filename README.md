# Machine Learning Models 🧠

This repository contains a collection of machine learning models implemented and tested using Google Colab as part of my learning and experimentation in machine learning.

## 📌 Overview
The goal of this project is to explore core machine learning concepts through hands-on implementation, focusing on model training, evaluation, and performance analysis.

## 🧪 What’s Included
- Data preprocessing and feature handling
- Model training and testing
- Evaluation using standard metrics
- Visualization of results and learning behavior

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Python**
- **Google Colab**
- **NumPy, Pandas**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn**

## 🎯 Purpose
- Strengthen understanding of machine learning fundamentals
- Practice building and evaluating models
- Experiment with different datasets and approaches

## 📈 Status
Ongoing — new models and experiments are added as learning progresses.
